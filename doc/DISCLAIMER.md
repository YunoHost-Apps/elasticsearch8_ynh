### Limitations
 - **Not totally free**: Licensed under SSPL, see for more information: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License>
 - Currently the security is disabled
 - Therefore, the package is configured to remain not public for now (i.e. not accessible through the web, the apps depending on it should be installed on the same server)
 - Not scalable for now
