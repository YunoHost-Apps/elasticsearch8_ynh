## Overview

Elasticsearch is the distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine at the heart of the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products). You can use Elasticsearch to store, search, and manage data for:
 - Logs
 - Metrics
 - A search backend
 - Application monitoring
 - Endpoint security

... and more!

To learn more about Elasticsearch’s features and capabilities, see the [product page](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

## Disclaimers / important information

### Limitations
 - **Not totally free**: Licensed under SSPL, see for more information: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License>
 - Currently the security is disabled
 - Therefore, the package is configured to remain not public for now (i.e. not accessible through the web, the apps depending on it should be installed on the same server)
 - Not scalable for now

## :red_circle: Antifeatures

- **Not totally free upstream**: The packaged app is under an overall free licence, but with clauses that restrict its use.
